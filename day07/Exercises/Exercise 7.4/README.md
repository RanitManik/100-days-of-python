# Exercise 7.4 - Keeping Track of the Player's Lives

## Introduction

This exercise builds on the previous steps, focusing on Keeping Track of the Player's Lives and improve the game with
ascii art.

## Starting Code

```python
# Step 4

    # TODO-3: - print the ASCII art from 'stages' that corresponds to the current number of 'lives' the user has remaining.
