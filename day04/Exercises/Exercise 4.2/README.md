# Exercise 4.2 - Who's Paying

## Instructions

You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to
pay for everybody's food bill.

**Important**: You are not allowed to use the `choice()` function.

**Line 8** splits the string `names_string` into individual names and puts them inside a **List** called `names`. For
this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

## Example Input

```
Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
```

Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

## Example Output

```
Michael is going to buy the meal today!
```

## Hint

1. You might need the help of the `len()` function.
2. Remember that Lists start at index 0!
