# Exercise 5.4 - FizzBuzz

## Instructions

You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

> `Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.`

> `When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".`

>     `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 

>       `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`

e.g. it might start off like this:

```
`1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz`
```

`.... etc.`

## Hint

1. Remember your answer should start from 1 and go up to and including 100.

2. Each number/text should be printed on a separate line.
