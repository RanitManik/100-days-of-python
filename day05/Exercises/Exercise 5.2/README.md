# Exercise 5.2 - Highest Score

## Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. `student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

**Important** you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

> `The highest score in the class is: x`

## Example Input

```
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
```

In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: `[78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

## Example Output

```
The highest score in the class is: 91
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

## Hint

1. Think about the logic before writing code. How can you compare numbers against each other to see which one is larger?
