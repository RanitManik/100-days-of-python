# Password Generator

## Instructions

The program will ask:

```
How many letters would you like in your password?
```

```
How many symbols would you like?
```

```
How many numbers would you like?
```

The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. Use your
knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge.

## Easy Version (Step 1)

Generate the password in sequence. If the user wants

* 4 letters
* 2 symbols and
* 3 numbers

then the password might look like this:

```
fgdx$*924
```

You can see that all the letters are together. All the symbols are together and all the numbers follow each other as
well. Try to solve this problem first.

## Hard Version (Step 2)

When you've completed the easy version, you're ready to tackle the hard version. In the advanced version of this project
the final password does not follow a pattern. So the example above might look like this:

```
x$d24g*f9
```

And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
