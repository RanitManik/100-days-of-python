# Exercise 2.1 - Data Types

## Instructions

Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit
number.

## Example Input

```
39
```

## Example Output

3 + 9 = 12

```
12
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

## Hint

1. Try to find out the data type of two_digit_number.
2. Think about what you learnt about subscripting.
3. Think about type conversion.
