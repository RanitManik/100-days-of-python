# Exercise 3.1 - Odd or Even

## Instructions

Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

e.g. 86 is **even** because 86 ÷ 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is **odd** because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

The **modulo** is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

e.g.

6 ÷ 2 = 3 with no remainder.

```
6 % 2 = 0
```

5 ÷ 2 = 2 x **2** + 1, remainder is 1.

```
5 % 2 = 1
```

14 ÷ 4 = 3 x **4** + 2, remainder is 2.

```
14 % 4 = 2
```

**Warning** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

## Example Input 1

```
43
```

## Example Output 1

```
This is an odd number.
```

## Example Input 2

```
94
```

## Example Output 2

```
This is an even number.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

## Hint

1. All even numbers can be divided by 2 with 0 remainder.
2. Try some using the modulo with some odd numbers e.g.

```
3 % 2
```

```
5 % 2
```

```
7 % 2
```

Then try using the modulo with some even numbers e.g.

```
4 % 2
```

```
6 % 2
```

```
8 % 2
```
