# Treasure Island

## Instructions

Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out
the logic and the story's path in your program.

[To write your code according to my story, you can use this flow chart from draw.io to help you.](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Treasure%20Island%20Conditional.drawio##Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1oDe4ehjWZipYRsVfeAx2HyB7LCQ8_Fvi%26export%3Ddownload)

However, I think the fun part is writing your *own* story 😊

That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...

## Text Snippets from my example

* 'You\'re at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
* 'You\'ve come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to
  swim across.'
* "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do
  you choose?"
* "It\'s a room full of fire. Game Over."
* "You found the treasure! You Win!"
* "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
* "You chose a door that doesn\'t exist. Game Over."
* "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
* "You fell into a hole. Game Over."

## Escaping Characters

If you want to use multiple sets of quotes inside a single string, you might have to "escape" some of them using the
backslash `\`. You can see this in my first sentence: 'You\'re at a
crossroad...'. [More on escaping characters here.](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_escape_characters.asp)

## Extensions

Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case-sensitive. In other words, your
code should work regardless of whether your user answers "left" or "Left".

[You can also add your own ASCII art](https://ascii.co.uk/art). Just remember to add three single quotes `'''` at the
start and at the end of your artwork to turn it into a multi-line string.
