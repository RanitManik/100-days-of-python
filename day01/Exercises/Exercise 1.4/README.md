 # Exercise 1.4 - Variables

## Instructions

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 12-18. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any
value of a and b.

## Example Input

```
a: 3
```

```
b: 5
```

## Example Output

```
a: 5
```

```
b: 3
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

## Hint

1. You should not have to type any numbers in your code.
2. You might need to make some more variables.
